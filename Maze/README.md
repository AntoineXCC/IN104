## Maze
The objective of the project is to solve the maze problem using a reinforcement learning algorithm. We will use the Q learning and Sarsa method, the choice of actions will be made according to epsilon-greedy or boltzmann method. The program will display the number of loops needed to solve the problem at each step and the length of the path determined by the algorithm at each step

## How to run the programm
1. Type "make", then "./maze" to run the programm
2. Choose learning method (1. Q learning 2. Sarsa), choose action policy (1. Epsilon greedy 2. Boltzmann)
3. Type "make clean"
