## Maze
The objective of the project is to solve the maze problem using reinforcement learning algorithms. The first part would involve selecting the approriate action using 2 different policies -- Epsilon-Greedy and Boltzmann. Subsequently, we will update the Q-table by using Q-Learning and SARSA. At the end of the programme, it will display the number of steps needed to solve the problem for each loop.

## How to run the programme
1. Type "make", then "./maze" to run the programm
2. Choose learning method (1. Q learning 2. Sarsa), choose action policy (1. Epsilon greedy 2. Boltzmann)
3. Type "make clean"
